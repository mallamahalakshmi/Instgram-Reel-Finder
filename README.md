# Instgram-Reel-Finder
**Problem Statement ** 
In recent trends, many Instagram influencers create multi-part reels (e.g., Part 1, Part 2) to boost engagement. However, locating a continuation reel (like Part 2) on their profile becomes increasingly difficult — especially if the reel was posted a long time ago, buried under many others.
**Solution Summary**
To address this, I developed a Chrome Extension that:

Accepts a reel link (e.g., Part 1).

Automatically navigates to the creator’s profile.

Locates and highlights the exact reel in their grid.

Makes it easy to spot and continue watching or find related parts (e.g., Part 2 or Part 3).

This tool saves time, avoids manual scrolling, and enhances user experience by streamlining reel discovery on content-heavy profiles.

**How to Use the Chrome Extension:**

Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.

Enable Developer Mode (top-right toggle).

Click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files.

Once loaded, click on the extension icon in the toolbar.

Paste any Instagram reel link into the input field and click the button.

The extension will automatically open the creator’s profile and highlight the exact reel.
